## Crystal collector game.

The crystal collector game allows you to click on a crystal and each crystal has a number assigned to it. The computer will generate a random number. The goal is to match the number to the computers choice without going over. I made some improvements to this homework assignment. I made it so that the game restarts everytime you win and the crystals change numbers too with every game.
